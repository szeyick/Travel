## The Adventure Begins

Date: 24/9/15

Started the day off in a massive rush, I suppose it happens since I had neglected to pack up until the morning that we were scheduled to leave but hey, YOLO right?

Anyway, after the frantic rush of the morning and trying to get everything organised, we had to say bye to Pepper who we were leaving for a month. This is the first time that the both of us will be away from our furry baby so it'll be interesting to see how it pans out, definitely sad to leave her behind though.

Soon afterwards it was off to the airport where Beckett was acting as our unofficial Uber driver. Funnily enough he did get a massive greasy from the cabbie that came past the apartment when we were loading our luggage into the car, we suspect that he was taking down Becketts car details, watch this space to see what happens.

At least we made it to the airport without a major scuffle so that's always a positive start but after the goodbyes we had a long journey ahead of us, 9 hours to Hong Kong, followed by a 3 hour layover for another 5 hour flight to Tokyo. What did we get ourselves into?

### During the Flight

The problem that I find with flying is the amount of waiting around that you do, check in...waiting, customs...waiting, immigration...waiting, it seems that all you really do is wait. So there's not much else that is terribly exciting to write about for the flight, with the exception of the following.

- **Hoay's Food**

Being lactose and fructose intolerant she thought it'd be at least the right thing to do to order the lactose free option for plane meals, my my was she going to regret that decision. 

Observe the meal below -

Yes it is true that economy class aeroplane food is never the best, but compare her meal option to mine and the evidence is clear, never order alternative meal options.

But being the nice guy I am, I decided to share

### Hong Kong

So after 9 hours, we finally got to Hong Kong, only 2/3rds of our journey for the day. Now we had another few hours to loiter at the airport before flying out again.

Given that we had almost just eaten on the plane, there really isn't much else to do at airports. Luckily for us, they do have free WiFi so it makes the time go slightly quicker. Skip forward a little bit and we're on the plane again.

### Land of the Rising Sun

Sleeping on the plane is an acquired art, unless you have the flxibility of a Chinese gymnast its next to impossible to have any kind of decent sleep in cattle class.

I somehow managed to contort myself into a rediculous position and made the most of it to catch a few hours of sleep.

When I finally woke, the sun was coming up over the horizon and we were about to land in Tokyo. But no, we weren't going to land into Tokyo immediately, first we'd be teased that we'd be landing, then we'd come back up and have to circle around again. I suppose when there's low visibility on the ground, its easier to pull up and try again than crash into the ground.

So after another 20 minute delay we were finally on the ground, then more waiting through the same process of immigration, customs and baggage claim we thought we were clear, we'd be off to central Tokyo!!

NOPE....the office where we had to reclaim our rail passes didn't open for another hour or so, so guess what we had to do? Yup wait some more.

Still, cant' be all that bad, we managed fit in a nice quick breakfast at the local 7-11, a quick change of clothes and we were finally able to get our tickets, then wait some more for our train to take us into Shibuya.

So now here I am sitting on the train writing this first journal entry whilst Hoay is trying to get some shut eye as the landscape of Japan flies past past.

Tell you what is cool so far though, the fact that the trains are right on point, and that the same train can just split into 2 and go in separate directions.
