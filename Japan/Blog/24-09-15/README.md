## All We Do Is Eat Eat Eat No Matter What

**Date: 24/9/15**

### Shibuya

So 24 hours since we left our apartment, we've finally arrived at Shibuya Station. Feeling tired and all icky, we still have a few more hours to burn before we could check into what will be our home for the next week.

Navigating the labyrinth that is Shibuya station wasn't as bad as we had imaged given we still had all our luggage, we missed the morning rush so it was relatively easy going. 

An awesome thing about Japan so far is that train stations have large storage lockers for people exactly like us who need a place to dump their luggage for a while. Free from our cumbersome suitcases, we could finally begin our Japanese adventure.

### Hachiko

The tale of the ever faithful Akita that made the trip to Shibuya Station every single day for 9 years to await his masters return is a story that tugs at the heart strings.

For those that want the Hollywood summary of the story, check out **Hachi** starring Richard Gere.

The undying loyalty of Hachiko has been memorialised at Shibuya Station with a bronze statue in his name. Aside from the crazy crossing, is one of the many highlights of Shibuya.

The statue is constantly surrounded by tourists and passers by all aiming to get an uninterrupted photo. Have to have ninja like quickness to get it though.

Being there during the mid morning on a working day appeared to be the best strategy since it was reasonably quiet. We did return later in the day and it was next to impossible to even get near him.

Being mid morning, we decided to get some proper food since we hadn't had anything other than airport or plane food in the past day.

### First Proper Meal

The best thing about the internet age is the ability to type into Google - **Best ____ in ____** and it'll return you an unlimited list of interesting things to do and eat, plus it helps you to avoid the tourist traps also.

I suppose being in Japan, we should try some Japanese food. First thing to tick off the list, ramen!

We went for a small walk around to find **Ichiran**, a ramen restaurant tucked away beneath some stairs. The first thing you encounter when you enter isn't a waitress, but rather a machine with an assortment of buttons with Japanese descriptions beneath. Fortunately, for the non Japanese speaking, there's pictures.

The idea is to put your order down and pay at the machine, to which then you're seated. Then you sit in your own little secluded booth where you fill out your ramen preferences then place your order and preferences through a wall where the waitress reads out your order. You never see them other than their kimono, so it's a strange little experience to have food passed through to you through a slot, much like you would in prison.

I think being from Melbourne, one thing that we do have an abundance of other than rain is good food. Whilst this ramen was pretty good, I'd say that what we have in Melbourne nowadays definitely is up there in terms of matching the authenticity of what you can find here.

### Going on Walkabout

So without a home until later in the afternoon, we managed to get our tired legs working and went for a walk to Harajuku. The walk was definitely further than expected but I suppose whilst you're on holiday you'd want to do as much as exploring on foot rather than be underground in a train.

Suprisingly, Harajuku was really quiet. Perhaps it was the middle of the day on a Thursday but there didn't seem to be many people around. A quick walk around and we were done so we decided to go up to Yoyogi Park.

### Yoyogi Park and Meiji Shrine

When you reach Yoyogi Park, you're greeted by a gigantic tori gate, its one of those things that you really need to see to put it into perspective how small we are since photo's don't really seem to do it justice.

Within the bounds of the park is the shrine dedicated to Emperor Meiji who is seen as responsible for the modernization of Japan after the arrival of Commodore Matthew Perry.

The Meiji period is seen as a tremendous era in Japanese history and the shrine is built as a dedication and a reminder of the achievements of the emperor in his time.

Before reaching the main shrine grounds, there's a wall of wine and sake barrels, offerings from all around Japan for the sake and wine from France.

When you reach the shrine grounds, there's a small area where you can wash your hands and wrinse your mouth so you're clean before you step into the shrine. There's instructions on the process but it can still be a little confusing for the uninitiated.

Within the shrine there's a couple of things to see and do, there's a prayer wall where you can write your prayers and hang them up and another area where you can pay your respects to the emperor. It's definitely a serene area and all the workers there take their job very seriously, constantly ensuring that everything is in an emmaculate state.

After the long walk through the park and some time at the shrine, it was time to finally check into our accomodation, so the long walk back began.

### A Home Away From Home

Our accomodation was a small walk from Shibuya station, through a maze of windy streets where cars and people share the same space. How people don't get run over is beyond me but somehow it seems to work. After fiddling around with how to actually get our keys, we finally made camp, finally able to sit down and relax a full 28 hours after leaving Melbourne.

You definitely appreciate the simple things in life after a long ass journey, like a bed and a hot shower. Without even trying Hoay and I both fell asleep within 5 minutes of lying down, we needed the short nap to recharge the batteries.

### Feeling Peckish

Once we felt a little fresher, we decided to check out the food that Shibuya had to offer. On the way to the apartment, we came across a fried chicken shop that we decided to go back to. Right next door to it however, was a pet store full of puppies and kittens, as cute as they were you couldnt help but feel a little sad about them being trapped there until someone decided to take them home.

Anymore onto more positive things, the chicken shop was awesome! Then again, you can't really go wrong with fried chicken, and this place continued that trend. Simple fried chicken with your choice of toppings, a nice little snack.

### Eating After Snacking

After the quick pitstop for chicken, we ended up at **Hoshino Coffee**, a small cafe that overlooks Shibuya Crossing that's famous for their slow drip coffee. Not being big coffee drinks, we both ended up getting tea's, but its the desserts that we really came for.

We tried 2, a souffle cheesecake and a souffle pancake. I'd say that the cheesecake was the better of the two since the pancake sort of reminded us of a really fluffy version of the short stack at Pancake Parlour.

It was nice to spend some time to just kick back and relax, to take in the fact that after a full day of travelling there, that we're finally in Japan.

### Shibuya Crossing

The famous crossing that comes up in almost every movie that takes place in Tokyo. Although the rains were out today, it still didn't dampen the spectacle of watching the hordes of people making the seemingly chaotic journey to cross the road.

And in a place where you probably won't get shamed for using a selfie stick, why not take a picture of yourself in the middle of the crossing.


![alt text](https://github.com/szeyick/Travel/blob/master/Japan/Blog/24-09-15/images/shibuyaSelfie.JPG "Nothing can go wrong with chicken")

After all, its not like you'll ever see any of these people again anyway :). 

### Eating Again

I think the biggest difference between this Japan trip and the previous one is that this one will be mostly about eating. 

Not even 2 hours after we finished up at Hoshino Coffee, we found ourselves satisfying our sashimi cravings at **Kaikaya**. It's a trendy little place filled with polaroids of past diners and all types of pictures of seafood.

All the seafood served there has been brought in fresh daily from the famous Tsukiji fish market and it definitely tastes like it. We ordered the small sashimi platter, a softshell crab patte thing and tiger prawns.

The tiger prawns were particularly interesting as they were essentially killed right in front of you. The prawns are brought over to your table live and kicking, and are then drowned in alcohol where you watch them twitch away before they are taken away and cooked. 

When they were initially brought over, we were both worried that we'd be eating live prawns, since we'd seen those freaky YouTube video's of wriggling squids, we didn't think it'd be too far fetched, but luckily they were taken away and cooked.

The prawns in the end were quite delicious although the preshow spectacle was somewhat morbid as you'd literally watch your dinner die. The rest of the dishes were also spot on, in particular the sashimi as you could really taste the freshness.

After polishing all that food off, we ended with some dessert, a sakura flower gelato and a earl grey gelato. Good thing about the sakura gelato was that it didn't really taste like flowers, like lavendar flavoured stuff, **ewwwww**.

I'd definitely recommend Kaikawa, the food is amazing, staff are very helpful and attentive and the general atmosphere of the restaurant is what you'd come to expect when eating at a Japanese place.

After dinner, we decided to call an early evening given that we'd been on the road for such a long time and there was definitely no arguments there. A quick pop by the local Family Mart and it was home and off to bed.

### Today's Observations

So our first semi-full day in Japan and there was plenty to write home about, today's interesting observations include -

- **So many people have clear umbrellas**

It seems that 90% of people that we saw on the street tonight had a clear umbrella. There must have been a massive sale on lately.

- **White is the staple shirt colour for Japanese salarymen**

Very common theme amongst Japanese salarymen is the white shirt. Seems like an interesting situation during the summer months when its hot and humid in Japan.

- **Endless Food Options**

There is so much food to around to try and eat, I'm not too sure how we're going to fit it in. 

- **Socks and heels/sandles are a thing**

No longer do we have the Dad sandles and socks, we've got women wearing heels or sandles with socks, I wonder if it'll take off overseas.

- **People talk to each other rather than through their phones**

A generalisation of course, but a very noticeable trend these days that Asian couples or friends for that matter who dine out often seem to just play on their phones. Thought it'd be the same here, but doesn't appear so. People genuinely want to enjoy the other persons company.
